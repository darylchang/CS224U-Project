   Here are some tornado facts from the National Weather Service,
Insurance Information Institute and news accounts:
   _Tornadoes can occur in any month, but are more frequent from
April through June and between 3 and 6 p.m.
   _Most tornadoes track southwest to northeast, but their paths
can spiral erratically.
   _The portion of a thunderstorm adjacent to large hail is where
tornadoes are most likely to occur.
   _There were 32 tornado-related deaths reported in 1988, down
from 59 in 1987 and well below the average of 99 a year.
   _Less than 2 percent of all tornadoes are classified as violent,
with wind speeds of more than 200 mph and a path averaging 26
miles. The longest tornado on record went 219 miles across
Missouri, Illinois and Indiana in March 1925.
   _Tornadoes travel at an average 30 mph, but can stand still or
go 70 mph.
   _The largest single outbreak of twisters on record was in April
1974, when 148 storms killed 300 people in 13 states over two days.
   _When a tornado threatens, seek shelter in the basement or
central parts of the house, office or school building, away from
windows.
