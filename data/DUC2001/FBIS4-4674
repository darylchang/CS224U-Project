  [Text] Tokyo -- An F-15 fighter of the U.S. Forces on 
Okinawa crashed near Kadena Air Base on 4 April. Commenting on 
the crash, Akira Takeshita, deputy director general of the 
Defense Facilities Administration Agency [DFAA], said, "Such a 
crash should not have occurred and it is very regrettable that 
the crash actually occurred." He also made it clear that 
shortly after the crash, the DFAA asked the command of the U.S. 
Forces in Japan [USFJ] to take thorough measures for safe 
management of the U.S. military bases on Okinawa and conduct a 
thorough investigation into the cause of the crash. 
  The Kadena Air Base public affairs office gave a briefing on 
the crash and the DFAA released the briefing. The briefing said: 
An F-15 fighter taking off from Kadena Air Base on a routine 
training crashed near the air base at 0924 on 4 April. The 
crashed aircraft belonged to the 44th Fighter Squadron of the 
18th Wing and the pilot safely ejected from the aircraft without 
injuries. A team will begin investigating the cause of the 
crash and details of the accident will be made public once the 
investigation is completed. 
  The U.S. military aircraft crashed about 800 meters 
northeast 
of a Kadena Air Base runway and the crash site is within the air 
base's facilities. 
  Mr. Takeshita said: "As for the safe management of the U.S. 
military bases on Okinawa, we have long asked the U.S. side for 
it. The DFAA immediately expressed regret to the command of the 
U.S. Forces in Yokota over the crash and the Naha DFAA Bureau 
expressed regret to the commander of the U.S. Forces on Okinawa. 
We will continue to ask them to work for the safe management of 
the U.S. military bases in Japan."
