<CAPTION>  Photos (2); PHOTO: Associated Press; ECLIPSE RITUALS -- In Santiago Atitlan,
Guatemala, a solar eclipse is cause for a great and noisy celebration, says
Nicolas Sepalu Toj, at left. Toj, a member of the Brotherhood of Maximon -- a
Mayan god represented by the icon at right -- explains his townspeople's
beliefs regarding eclipses. They traditionally burn incense, ring church bells
and wave farming tools to scare away the gargantuan bat that they believe
obscures the sun during an eclipse.; PHOTO: Angela Pancrazio -- Mercury News;

<LEADPARA>  One by one the customers filtered out of the Orion Telescope Center, eclipsing
personal dignity in their zeal to view the sun through geeky,
fluorescent-green paper eyeshades.;    "It works: I see the sun," exclaimed
customer Jim Maurer as he peered at the Cupertino sky through his five-buck
Startrap Eclipse Viewers. "But I can't see anything else. . . . You know, I
don't think it's safe to drive in these."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Sure, he'll be able to see Thursday's solar eclipse. But, oh, if only he
and the hundreds of other customers could see themselves in the mirror,
looking like an audience for a 3-D horror flick.;    It appears from the way
people in the Golden State have been acting these days that they have been in
the sun too long. Actually, they can't wait to get into the shadow. Millions
of Californians will pause Thursday morning to join in an international
ritual: watching the longest-lasting solar eclipse until 2132.;    "What other
natural phenomenon can you be involved in and not get killed?" said Bert
Beecher, spokesman for the Minolta Planetarium at De Anza College. "It's a lot
safer than being in a volcano.";    Eyeshades a hot item;  Bay Area people
Tuesday were desperately seeking eyeshades. It took 24 hours for Orion
Telescope in Cupertino to sell its stock of 900 Eclipse Viewers, which are
made with Mylar plastic lenses and supposedly safe for eclipse viewing.
Welding supply stores were inundated with calls for welder's glasses made with
the same plastic.;    Local planetariums and observatories were deluged with
requests from people wanting to attend solar viewing sessions, even though the
Bay Area will be privy only to a partial eclipse -- 63 percent coverage of the
sun by the moon from 10:10 a.m. to 12:34 p.m.;    Some Bay Area "umbraphiles"
-- lovers of the shadow -- were leaving few details to chance.;    Flights
heavily booked;  Flights from here to Mexico and Hawaii -- where the eclipse
can be seen in total -- were heavily booked by sunstruck people spending
thousands of dollars to stand in 6 minutes, 53 seconds of darkness.;    Scott
Wiener, a computer company executive from Saratoga, is flying with two buddies
to Baja, where thousands will toast the corona with Coronas.;    "I figure
we'll get there in time to see the eclipse from a cab," said Wiener, who stood
in line at the telescope store Tuesday for the Eclipse Viewers. "We'll put on
the glasses and stick our heads out the window.;    "I figure it's worth it. I
don't know if I'll be around for the next one in 150 years."; WHERE TO WATCH;
