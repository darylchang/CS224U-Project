<LEADPARA>  Hispanics, whose incidence of diabetes is two to three times as high as the
population of the United States as a whole, can learn how to manage the
illness at a free half-day clinic Saturday at St. Louise Health Center in
Morgan Hill.;    Heredity and diet appear to be the major reasons that 14 to
21 percent of Hispanics -- and up to 40 percent in the 64 to 75 age group --
contract diabetes, said Rochelle McNamara, executive director of the Diabetes
Society of Santa Clara Valley.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     About 7 percent of the general population has diabetes, McNamara said.;   
Hispanics who have strong American Indian ancestry may be vulnerable to
diabetes because about 50 percent of all Indians develop diabetes, McNamara
said. Also, the high-fat diet of many Hispanics leads to obesity, which seems
to trigger diabetes, McNamara said.;    Eighty percent of Hispanics over 40
who are diagnosed as diabetic are overweight, she said.;    The clinic
Saturday will focus on three ways to manage diabetes -- diet, exercise and
medication. Participants will learn that traditional dishes can be just as
tasty -- but healthier -- when made with unsaturated fats, and that exercise
will reduce weight, which in turn will lower the possibility of contracting
diabetes.;    "There is no magic pill to cure diabetes. You have to manage
your own diabetes, and we're teaching people how to take care of themselves,"
McNamara said.;    The hospital and the diabetes society are sponsoring
neighborhood diabetes programs for Hispanics, which are taught by bilingual
instructors.;    The programs, which first began in 1984, are aimed at people
who speak only Spanish or people who are more comfortable receiving
instruction in that language.;    "We found that the regular programs that we
started years ago were not reaching the monolingual Spanish-speaker," McNamara
said.;     IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; The diabetes management program for Hispanics
will be from 9 a.m. to noon at St. Louise Health Center, 18500 St. Louise
Drive, off Cochrane Road in Morgan Hill. Registration begins at 8:30 a.m.
