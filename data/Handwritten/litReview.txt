Unsupervised Graph-Based Keyword Extraction

In recent years, research in Natural Language Processing has transitioned towards more mathematical approaches. Most major problems in NLP including word sense disambiguation, extractive summarization, multi-document summarization, lexical relatedness, and parsing have made significant improvements due to new techniques in machine learning and statistics. Therefore, the aim of most recent NLP papers is to invent, innovate, and improve upon these existing statistical methods and evaluation metrics to answer the basic questions of natural language understanding. From the nine papers analyzed for this literature review, we were able to synthesize a list of pros and cons between two main approaches to solving the problem of keyword extraction and sentence summarization.

        	The two main approaches to solving the problem of keyword extraction have been supervised machine learning algorithms and graph-based centrality algorithms. ML-based algorithms include regression models, decision trees, support vector machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, Na√Øve Bayes, and train upon a development set of documents labeled with their respective list of keywords to generate parameter values used in predicting keywords for novel documents. In contrast, most of the graph-based, unsupervised algorithms discussed in the papers we read involve generating graph networks based on various measures of similarity between documents, and then computing PageRank scores or other centrality measures to rank candidate keywords. This unsupervised approach not only tries to improve upon accuracy of keyword generation compared to state of the art supervised learning algorithms, but also aims to reduce the amount of human labor required in making pre-labeled testing sets, which is often a strict bottleneck in development. In the rest of this review, we will analyze the various graph-based approaches, compare their results to traditional solutions to keyword extraction and text summarization, and formulate a project that builds off previous work in unsupervised keyword extraction.
