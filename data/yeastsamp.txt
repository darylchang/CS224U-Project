Cells make accurate decisions in the face of molecular
noise and environmental fluctuations by relying
not only on present pathway activity, but also on their
memory of past signaling dynamics. Once a decision
is made, cellular transitions are often rapid and
switch-like due to positive feedback loops in the regulatory
network. While positive feedback loops are
good at promoting switch like transitions, they are
not expected to retain information to inform subsequent
decisions. However, this expectation is based
on our current understanding of network motifs that
accounts for temporal, but not spatial, dynamics.
Here, we show how spatial organization of the feedback-driven
yeast G1/S switch enables the transmission
of memory of past pheromone exposure across
this transition. We expect this to be one of many examples
where the exquisite spatial organization of
the eukaryotic cell enables previously well-characterized
network motifs to perform new and unexpected
signal processing functions.
